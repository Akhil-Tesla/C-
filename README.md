# C-
Programs for C Language 



          #include<stdio.h>
             int main()
          {
            printf("Hello World\n");
             return 0;
           }



Include function includes the header file which is <stdio.h>
Stdio stands for standard Input and Output  ( .h ) represents the header file


The int  defines main functions Type 
 Int  literally means integer return type I.e n  = 1,2,3 ....   . in the int  main function we can include any type of the data type
Like float, double, char etc but best option is Void which returns Null   0
